## Brevo Mailing List Integration

This project uses Brevo (formerly Sendinblue) for mailing list management. To set up the integration:

### 1. Create a Brevo Account

1. Sign up at [Brevo](https://www.brevo.com/)
2. Verify your email and complete the setup

### 2. Get Your API Key

1. Go to [Brevo API Keys](https://app.brevo.com/settings/keys/api)
2. Create a new API key with the following permissions:
   - Contacts: Read, Write
   - Lists: Read
3. Copy the generated API key

### 3. Create a Contact List

1. Go to [Brevo Contact Lists](https://app.brevo.com/contact/list)
2. Create a new list for your mailing list subscribers
3. Note the List ID (you can find it in the URL or list settings)

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Edit `.env` and add your Brevo credentials:
   ```
   VITE_BREVO_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
   VITE_BREVO_LIST_ID=your_actual_list_id_here
   ```

### 5. Test the Integration

1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to the footer section
3. Enter an email address in the mailing list form
4. Check your Brevo dashboard to confirm the contact was added

### Important Notes

- The `.env` file is ignored by git for security
- Never commit your actual API keys to version control
- The integration handles duplicate emails gracefully
- For production deployment, set the environment variables in your hosting platform

## Netlify Deployment

When deploying to Netlify, you need to set up environment variables in the Netlify dashboard:

1. Go to your Netlify site dashboard
2. Navigate to Site settings > Environment variables
3. Add the following environment variables:
   - `VITE_BREVO_API_KEY`: Your Brevo API key
   - `VITE_BREVO_LIST_ID`: Your Brevo list ID

4. Redeploy your site to apply the environment variables

If you're experiencing issues with the Brevo integration in production:

1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Verify that the environment variables are correctly set in Netlify
3. Make sure the API key has the correct permissions in Brevo
4. Check if the list ID is correct
