### 4. Get Your EmailJS Credentials

From your EmailJS dashboard, collect these values:
- Public Key: Go to "Account" → "General" → "Public Key"
- Service ID: From the service you created
- Template IDs: From each template you created

### 5. Update Environment Variables

1. Open your .env file (NOT .env.example)
2. Add these EmailJS variables:

```
# EmailJS Integration for Form Notifications
VITE_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=rmCMxAjEuWQKfB51Q
VITE_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=service_4znvnz9
VITE_EMAILJS_BOOKING_TEMPLATE_ID=template_4zn5cnv
VITE_EMAILJS_CONTACT_TEMPLATE_ID=template_y435lc5
VITE_NOTIFICATION_EMAIL=connect@diananivara.com
```

3. Replace all placeholder values with your actual EmailJS credentials
4. Set VITE_NOTIFICATION_EMAIL to the email where you want to receive notifications

### 6. Test the Setup

1. Restart your development server: `npm run dev`
2. Go to your website
3. Fill out and submit the booking form
4. Fill out and submit the contact form
5. Check your email for notifications

### 7. Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues:

**"Email service not configured" error:**
- Check that all environment variables are set correctly
- Make sure you restarted the dev server after adding variables
- Verify the variable names match exactly (case-sensitive)

**Emails not being received:**
- Check your spam/junk folder
- Verify the VITE_NOTIFICATION_EMAIL is correct
- Check EmailJS dashboard for error logs
- Make sure your email service is properly connected in EmailJS

**Template variables not showing:**
- Ensure template variable names match exactly ({{client_name}}, etc.)
- Check for typos in template variable names
- Variables are case-sensitive

#### Testing in Development:
- EmailJS works in development mode
- Check browser console for any error messages
- Use browser network tab to see if requests are being sent

#### Production Deployment:
- Environment variables need to be set in your hosting platform
- For Netlify: Set variables in Site Settings → Environment Variables
- For Vercel: Set variables in Project Settings → Environment Variables
